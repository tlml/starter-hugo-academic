        *   Co-Investigator of LET (Low Energy Telescope) for EPD 
            (Energetic Particle Detector), selected for Solar Orbiter 
         mission, Turku, Finland, 2006-2012
        *   Member of the SOHO/ERNE (Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei
            Experiment) PI team, Turku, Finland, 1996-2010
        *   AMS (Antimatter Spectrometer) ground support team 1997&#x2013;2000
        *   IHP/HEX (The Interstellar Heliopause Probe/Heliospheric
            Explorer) proposal for ESA \`\`Cosmic Vision
            2015&#x2013;2025'' framework, 2007, Interstellar Probe
            proposal, 2013
  - title: Analysis of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) observations
    description: |2
        *   Observational evidence of multiple SEP injections during a solar
            eruption, and their relation to multiwavelength solar observations
        *   Influence of coronal and interplanetary structures on the observed
            SEP fluxes, including the ability of SEPs to traverse through
            preceding coronal mass ejections
        *   Geoeffectiveness of solar eruptions that produce SEPs
  - title: SEP, Solar wind and turbulence modelling
    description: >-
        *   Concurrent modelling of turbulent solar wind heating and SEP
            acceleration and propagation, to find mismatch on required
            turbulence energy to explain the solar wind and SEP observations
        *   Developing turbulence transport models for use with SEP transport
            simulations 
        *   First consistent modelling of SEP acceleration at coronal shocks
            with time-dependent wave amplification by streaming particles 
        *   Full-orbit simulations to model cross-field transport of SEPs

        *   Study showing that spatial diffusion approach cannot be used to
            describe SEP cross-field transport early in the event 
        *   Study of the effect of structures, nonlinear evolution and
            scale-dependent anisotropy of turbulence on energetic particle
            propagation 
        *   Study of the effects of large-scale magnetic structures in the
            heliospheric magnetic fields [My CV]({{< ref "cv/index.md" >}}
