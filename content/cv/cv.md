## **Research Activities and Achievements:**

The numbers in square brackets refer to the Refereed Journal
Articles in the List of Publications.

-   **Instrumentation**
    -   Co-Investigator of LET (Low Energy Telescope) for EPD 
        (Energetic Particle Detector), selected for Solar Orbiter 
         mission, Turku, Finland, 2006-2012
    -   Member of the SOHO/ERNE (Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei
        Experiment) PI team, Turku, Finland, 1996-2010
    -   AMS (Antimatter Spectrometer) ground support team 1997&#x2013;2000
    -   IHP/HEX (The Interstellar Heliopause Probe/Heliospheric Explorer)
        proposal for ESA \`\`Cosmic Vision 2015&#x2013;2025'' framework, 2007 [32,
        33], Interstellar Probe proposal, 2013
-   **Analysis of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) observations**
    -   Observational evidence of multiple SEP injections during a solar
        eruption, and their relation to multiwavelength solar observations
        [9, 13, 24]
    -   Influence of coronal and interplanetary structures on the observed
        SEP fluxes, including the ability of SEPs to traverse through
        preceding coronal mass ejections [3-4, 31, 34]
    -   Geoeffectiveness of solar eruptions that produce SEPs [ 25 ]
-   **SEP, Solar wind and turbulence modelling**
    -   Concurrent modelling of turbulent solar wind heating and SEP
        acceleration and propagation, to find mismatch on required
        turbulence energy to explain the solar wind and SEP observations
        [17, 20-21, 1 on the Conf. Proc (ref) list]
    -   Developing turbulence transport models for use with SEP transport
        simulations [22, 27]
    -   First consistent modelling of SEP acceleration at coronal shocks
        with time-dependent wave amplification by streaming particles [28,
        30, 37, 44, 47; and 2, 3 on the Conf. Proc (ref) list]
    -   Full-orbit simulations to model cross-field transport of SEPs
        -   Study showing that spatial diffusion approach cannot be used to
            describe SEP cross-field transport early in the event [papers]({{< relref "/categories/SEP-transport-meandering" >}}) [43, 53,
            55, 57]
        -   Study of the effect of structures, nonlinear evolution and
            scale-dependent anisotropy of turbulence on energetic particle
            propagation [38, 40]
        -   Study of the effects of large-scale magnetic structures in the
            heliospheric magnetic fields [39, 42, 45, 51, 52, 54]
