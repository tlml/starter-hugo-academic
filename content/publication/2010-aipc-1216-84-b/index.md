abstract: We have developed a simulation model of particle acceleration in coronal
  shock waves. The model is based on a Monte Carlo method, where particles are traced
  in prescribed large-scale electromagnetic fields utilizing the guiding center approximation.
  The particles are scattered in the turbulence according to quasilinear theory, with
  the scattering amplitude directly proportional to the intensity of Alfvén waves
  at gyro-resonant wavenumbers. The Alfvén waves are traced simultaneously with the
  particles, so that the wave field is propagated outwards from the Sun using WKB
  propagation supplemented with a phenomenological wavenumber diffusion term and a
  growth rate computed from the net flux of the accelerated particles. We consider
  initial wave amplitudes small enough to allow rapid escape of particles from the
  shock to the ambient medium. Thus, in our model the Alfvén waves responsible for
  the diffusive acceleration of particles are generated by the accelerated particles
  themselves. In this work, we study the effects of non-constant shock velocity and
  non- monotonic Alfvén velocity on particle acceleration scenarios. We report in
  particular how the deceleration of a shock affects particle intensity and turbulence
  power evolution in the vicinity of the shock.
