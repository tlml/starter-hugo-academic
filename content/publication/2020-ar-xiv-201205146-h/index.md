abstract: Gamma-ray emission during long-duration gamma-ray flare (LDGRF) events is
  thought to be caused mainly by $>$300 MeV protons interacting with the ambient plasma
  at or near the photosphere. Prolonged periods of the gamma-ray emission have prompted
  the suggestion that the source of the energetic protons is acceleration at a coronal
  mass ejection (CME)-driven shock, followed by particle back-precipitation onto the
  solar atmosphere over extended times. We study the latter hypothesis using test
  particle simulations, which allow us to investigate whether scattering associated
  with turbulence aids particles in overcoming the effect of magnetic mirroring, which
  impedes back-precipitation by reflecting particles as they travel sunwards. The
  instantaneous precipitation fraction, $P$, the proportion of protons that successfully
  precipitate for injection at a fixed height, $r_i$, is studied as a function of
  scattering mean free path, $łambda$ and $r_i$. Upper limits to the total precipitation
  fraction, $øverlineP$, were calculated for eight LDGRF events for moderate scattering
  conditions ($łambda$=0.1 au). We find that the presence of scattering helps back-precipitation
  compared to the scatter-free case, although at very low $łambda$ values outward
  convection with the solar wind ultimately dominates. For eight LDGRF events, due
  to strong mirroring, $øverlineP$ is very small, between 0.56 and 0.93% even in the
  presence of scattering. Time-extended acceleration and large total precipitation
  fractions, as seen in the observations, cannot be reconciled for a moving shock
  source according to our simulations. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain both
  long duration $γ$ ray emission and efficient precipitation within this scenario.
  These results challenge the CME shock source scenario as the main mechanism for
  $γ$ ray production in LDGRFs.
