abstract: While major solar energetic particle (SEP) events are associated with coronal
  mass ejection (CME)-driven shocks in solar wind, accurate SEP measurements reveal
  that more than one component of energetic ions exist in the beginning of the events.
  Solar electromagnetic emissions, including nuclear gamma-rays, suggest that high-energy
  ions could also be accelerated by coronal shocks, and some of those particles could
  contribute to SEPs in interplanetary space. However, the CME-driven shock in solar
  wind is thought to shield any particle source beneath the shock because of the strong
  scattering required for the diffusive shock acceleration. In this Letter, we consider
  a shock model that allows energetic particles from the possible behind-shock source
  to appear in front of the shock simultaneously with SEPs accelerated by the shock
  itself. We model the energetic particle transport in directions parallel and perpendicular
  to the magnetic field in a spherical shock expanding through the highly turbulent
  magnetic sector with an embedded quiet magnetic tube, which makes the shock semi-transparent
  for energetic particles. The model energy spectra and time profiles of energetic
  ions escaping far upstream of the shock are similar to the profiles observed during
  the first hour of some gradual SEP events.
