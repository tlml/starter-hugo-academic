abstract: We analysed the solar particle event following the 9 July 1996 solar flare.
  High-energy protons were detected by the ERNE instrument on board SOHO. Anisotropy
  of arriving protons revealed very peculiar non-monotonic development. A short period
  of almost isotropic distribution was imbedded into the prolonged period of beam-like
  distribution of 14 17 MeV protons. This implies the existence of a narrow magnetic
  channel with a much smaller mean free path than in the surrounding quiet solar wind
  plasma. We used Monte Carlo simulations of interplanetary transport to fit the observed
  anisotropies and intensity time profiles. Proton injection and transport parameters
  are estimated. The injection scenario is found to be very close to the scenario
  of the 24 May 1990 event, but the intensity and the interplanetary transport parameters
  are different. The extreme anisotropy observed implies prolonged injection of high-energy
  protons at the Sun and at the interplanetary shock front, and either a very large
  mean free path (ensuremath≥ 5 AU) outside the slow transport channel, or alternatively,
  a somewhat smaller mean free path (ensuremath≈2 AU) and enhanced focusing between
  the Sun and the Earth.
