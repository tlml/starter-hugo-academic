abstract: Modelling of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) is usually carried out by
  means of the 1D focused transport equation and the same approach is adopted within
  several SEP Space Weather forecasting frameworks. We present an alternative approach,
  based on test particle simulations, which naturally describes 3D particle propagation.
  The SPARX forecasting system is an example of how test particle simulations can
  be used in real time in a Space Weather context. SPARX is currently operational
  within the COMESEP Alert System. The performance of the system, which is triggered
  by detection of a solar flare of class >M1.0 is evaluated by comparing forecasts
  for flare events between 1997 and 2017 with actual SEP data from the GOES spacecraft.
