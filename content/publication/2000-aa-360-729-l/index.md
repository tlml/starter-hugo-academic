abstract: 'Using spaceborne particle and gamma-ray detection and radio diagnostics
  we study solar energetic particle (SEP) production in the 1996 July 9 event. This
  event is associated with an impulsive soft X-ray flare (9:10 UT) and a coronal mass
  ejection (CME). In a global classification the event is considered as mixed- impulsive.
  A sequence of acceleration processes is identified, starting early in the flare
  impulsive phase and continuing throughout the period when the CME propagated up
  to several R$_solar$ above the photosphere: (1) Gamma-ray, hard X-ray and cm-wave
  emitting particles seen during the flare impulsive phase in the low corona had no
  counterpart at the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) spacecraft. (2) Electrons
  accelerated at a coronal shock wave were revealed by decimetric- to-metric type
  II radio emission and by simultaneous radio signatures of beams traveling to 1 AU.
  (3) Mildly relativistic (>=250 keV) electrons detected by SoHO did not correspond
  to these shock-accelerated populations, but to later mainly impulsive injection
  which was associated with radio brightenings over a large range of coronal altitudes.
  (4) Energetic protons detected by SoHO were accelerated during about 100 min after
  the flare impulsive phase with a gradually evolving production profile that bore
  some similarity with the time profile of broadband metric (type IV) emission. (5)
  While all other particle signatures decayed, a second period of interplanetary proton
  production took place >=2 hours after flare onset. The first, 100 min period of
  SEP acceleration, post-impulsive phase coronal acceleration, is definitely dominant
  in mildly relativistic electrons. Two acceleration periods nearly equally contribute
  to the production of åisebox-0.5ex~ 20 MeV protons. However, the second period is
  more productive in low energy, i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 1 MeV, protons. The timing of the
  SEP injections indicates that neither the impulsive flare acceleration in the low
  corona nor the interplanetary CME at >= 10 R$_solar$ are the main sources of the
  high-energy particles observed onboard SoHO. We suggest that various acceleration
  processes related to the reconfiguration of the corona in the course of the flare
  and CME lift-off contribute to the interacting and escaping particle populations,
  with different signatures at different energies and in different species.'
