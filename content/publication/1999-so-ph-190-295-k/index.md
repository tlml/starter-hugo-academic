abstract: We have analyzed five solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed aboard
  the SOHO spacecraft during 1996 1997. All events were associated with impulsive
  soft X-ray flares, Type II radio bursts and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most
  attention is concentrated on the SEP acceleration during the first 100 minutes after
  the flare impulsive phase, post-impulsive-phase acceleration, being observed in
  eruptions centered at different solar longitudes. As a representative pattern of
  a (nearly) well-connected event, we consider the west flare and CME of 9 July 1996
  (S10 W30). Similarities and dissimilarities of the post-impulsive-phase acceleration
  at large heliocentric-angle distance from the eruption center are illustrated with
  the 24 September 1997 event (S31 E19). We conclude that the proton acceleration
  at intermediate scales, between flare acceleration and interplanetary CME-driven
  shock acceleration, significantly contributes to the production of ensuremathgtrsim10
  MeV protons. This post-impulsive-phase acceleration seems to be caused by the CME
  lift-off.
