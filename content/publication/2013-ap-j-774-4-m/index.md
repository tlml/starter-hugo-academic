abstract: Drifts are known to play a role in galactic cosmic ray transport within
  the heliosphere and are a standard component of cosmic ray propagation models. However,
  the current paradigm of solar energetic particle (SEP) propagation holds the effects
  of drifts to be negligible, and they are not accounted for in most current SEP modeling
  efforts. We present full-orbit test particle simulations of SEP propagation in a
  Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which demonstrate that high-energy
  particle drifts cause significant asymmetric propagation perpendicular to the IMF.
  Thus in many cases the assumption of field-aligned propagation of SEPs may not be
  valid. We show that SEP drifts have dependencies on energy, heliographic latitude,
  and charge-to-mass ratio that are capable of transporting energetic particles perpendicular
  to the field over significant distances within interplanetary space, e.g., protons
  of initial energy 100 MeV propagate distances across the field on the order of 1
  AU, over timescales typical of a gradual SEP event. Our results demonstrate the
  need for current models of SEP events to include the effects of particle drift.
  We show that the drift is considerably stronger for heavy ion SEPs due to their
  larger mass-to-charge ratio. This paradigm shift has important consequences for
  the modeling of SEP events and is crucial to the understanding and interpretation
  of in situ observations.
