abstract: Dissipation of turbulence is generally considered as a prime candidate for
  the heating and acceleration of solar wind from the corona throughout the heliosphere,
  due to radially evolving dissipation processes and/or cascading of energy to dissipation
  scales. In order to model the latter consistently, we must consider the evolution
  of cross-helicity when modeling the strength of the cascade, as the non-linear interactions
  causing it require counterstreaming waves. In this paper, we present a simple model
  of non-WKB wave reflection from large-scale gradients, and apply the resulting cross-helicity
  to evaluate the evolution of the turbulence spectrum up to 0.3,AU by using a phenomenological
  cascade model. The study is restricted to a cascade in perpendicular direction.
  We study the ability of this spectral flux to heat the solar wind, and its dependence
  on the frequency of the excited waves. We find that the cascade, and, subsequently
  the heating, is considerably stronger than the one obtained by using ad-hoc modeling
  of the heating rates. The heating rate is also found to increase very fast toward
  the Sun, unlike the heating rates used in solar wind models capable of producing
  reasonable solar wind profiles.
