abstract: The onset of a Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) event has been traditionally
  determined by using the velocity dispersion analysis (VDA), where the event onset
  at the Sun is determined by fitting the solar onset time and the particles' path
  length to match the observed event onset at 1 AU for several SEP energy channels.
  This approach has been studied by using energetic particle simulations, in order
  to understand the effect of the interplanetary scattering on the arrival time of
  the first particles to 1 AU. In these studies, the SEP event onset at 1 AU has been
  defined as the time when the intensities reach certain percentage of the maximum
  of the event. This is often not feasible for practical work, as a real event may
  be complex in its structure, and the pre-event background may mask the SEP onset
  to differing degrees in different energies. In order to estimate the usability of
  the VDA method, we study the simulated SEP onset on a pre-existing particle background
  by varying the pre-event background level, the difference of the pre-event background
  and the simulated event maximum spectral indices, the interplanetary mean free path
  and the injection profile. As in the previous studies, we find that large path length
  variation can be explained as an artifact resulting from the use of the VDA method.
  More importantly, the error in the obtained solar onset time depends strongly on
  the properties of the pre-event background.
