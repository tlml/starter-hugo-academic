abstract: We investigate the deceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) during
  their propagation from the Sun through interplanetary space, in the presence of
  weak to strong scattering in a Parker spiral configuration, using relativistic full
  orbit test particle simulations. The calculations retain all three spatial variables
  describing particlestextquoteright trajectories, allowing us to model any transport
  across the magnetic field. Large energy change is shown to occur for protons, due
  to the combined effect of standard adiabatic deceleration and a significant contribution
  from particle drift in the direction opposite to that of the solar wind electric
  field. The latter drift-induced deceleration is found to have a stronger effect
  for SEP energies than for galactic cosmic rays. The kinetic energy of protons injected
  at 1 MeV is found to be reduced by between 35% and 90% after four days, and for
  protons injected at 100 MeV by between 20% and 55%. The overall degree of deceleration
  is a weak function of the scattering mean free path, showing that, although adiabatic
  deceleration plays a role, a large contribution is due to particle drift. Current
  SEP transport models are found to account for drift-induced deceleration in an approximate
  way and their accuracy will need to be assessed in future work.
