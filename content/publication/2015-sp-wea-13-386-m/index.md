abstract: The capability to predict the parameters of an SEP event such as its onset,
  peak flux, and duration is critical to assessing any potential space weather impact.
  We present a new flexible modeling system simulating the propagation of Solar Energetic
  Particles (SEPs) from locations near the Sun to any given location in the heliosphere
  to forecast the SEP flux profiles. Solar Particle Radiation SWx (SPARX) uses an
  innovative methodology that allows implementation within an operational framework
  to overcome the time constraints of test particle modeling of SEP profiles, allowing
  the production of near-real- time SEP nowcasts and forecasts, when paired with appropriate
  near-real-time triggers. SPARX has the capability to produce SEP forecasts within
  minutes of being triggered by observations of a solar eruptive event. The model
  is based on the test particle approach and is spatially 3-D, thus allowing for the
  possibility of transport in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. The
  model naturally includes the effects of perpendicular propagation due to drifts
  and drift-induced deceleration. The modeling framework and the way in which parameters
  of relevance for Space Weather forecasting are obtained are described. The first
  results from the modeling system are presented. These results demonstrate that corotation
  and drift of SEP streams play an important role in shaping SEP flux profiles.
