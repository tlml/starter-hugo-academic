abstract: On 2001 October 19-21 the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron
  (ERNE) instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) observed two
  gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events separated by 15 h, in association
  with two X1.6/2B solar flares and halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The observational
  data suggest that the second acceleration of Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~10-100 MeV protons occurred
  behind the first CME and the previous CME was not an obstacle for new particles
  to directly reach 1 AU. The proton flux anisotropy data support the idea that the
  particle production significantly declined in about 10 h after the shock wave started,
  while the prolonged temporal profile of the solar energetic particle event was due
  to a slow transport of previously accelerated particles in the interplanetary space.
  These observations call into question the view that in all gradual events high-energy
  particles are continuously produced at a CME bow shock as it travels from near the
  Sun to beyond 1 AU.
