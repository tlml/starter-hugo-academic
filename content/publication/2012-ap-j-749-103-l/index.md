abstract: In the full-orbit particle simulations of energetic particle transport in
  plasmas, the plasma turbulence is typically described as a homogeneous superposition
  of linear Fourier modes. The turbulence evolution is, however, typically a nonlinear
  process, and, particularly in the heliospheric context, the solar wind plasma is
  inhomogeneous due to the transient structures, as observed by remote and in situ
  measurements. In this work, we study the effects of the inhomogeneities on energetic
  particle transport by using spatially distributed, superposed turbulence envelopes.
  We find that the cross-field transport is significantly reduced, when compared to
  the results obtained with homogeneous turbulence. The reduction can reach an order
  of magnitude when the enveloping breaks the wave phase coherence along the mean
  magnetic field direction.
