abstract: The trajectories of solar energetic particles in an interplanetary magnetic
  field exhibiting large-scale fluctuations due to footpoint motions originating in
  the photosphere are simulated using a full-orbit test-particle code. The cross-field
  transport experienced by the particles in three propagation conditions (scatter-free,
  with scattering mean free path ensuremathłambda = 0.3 AU and ensuremathłambda =
  2 AU) is characterized in the Parker spiral geometry. The role of expansion of the
  magnetic field with radial distance from the Sun is taken into consideration in
  the calculation of particle displacements and diffusion coefficients from the output
  of the simulations. It is found that transport across the magnetic field is enhanced
  in the ensuremathłambda = 0.3 AU and ensuremathłambda = 2 AU cases, compared to
  the scatter- free case. Values of the ratios of perpendicular to parallel diffusion
  coefficients vary between 0.01 and 0.08. The ratio of latitudinal to longitudinal
  diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the magnetic field is typically 0.2, suggesting
  that transport in latitude may be less efficient.
