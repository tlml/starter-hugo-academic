abstract: Alfvén wave transport in the solar wind, including non-linear spectral energy
  transfer, is studied. We present numerical solutions of wave transport using a diffusive
  flux function previously introduced for spectral energy transfer, and compare it
  with the analytical solution obtained for a convective flux function. The two models
  of cascading produce very similar behavior of a power spectrum initially of 1/f-form
  at the solar surface, provided that the cascading constants are tuned to produce
  the same spectral flux in the inertial range. We present an analytical expression
  for the power spectrum of the diffusively-cascading Alfvén waves in the solar wind
  derived from a solution of the wave transport equation and show that it compares
  well with the exact solutions. Our expression enables (semi) analytical evaluation
  of the cyclotron heating rate, the wave pressure gradient, and the energetic-particle
  mean free path related to the Alfvén waves in the corona and solar wind.
