abstract: We report on Monte Carlo simulations of solar energetic particle (SEP) acceleration
  at quasi-parallel coronal shocks under the influence of self-generated Alfvén waves.
  The results indicate that the accelerated particles amplify ambient Alfvén waves
  efficiently and that the solution close to the shock can be qualitatively described
  with the results from quasi-steady theories of diffusive shock acceleration, provided
  that the acceleration and injection parameters do not change rapidly. The escape
  of the first particles to the interplanetary medium occurs before the waves have
  grown appreciably to trap the particles in the vicinity of the shock wave. The escape
  process is well described by the analytical model developed by Vainio, at least
  for the promptly escaping component. In addition to the compression ratio and speed
  of the shock wave, the rate of injection of low-energy particles to the acceleration
  process is a key factor for the acceleration efficiency of shocks that are driven
  by coronal mass ejection. Quasi-parallel coronal shocks seem to be capable of accelerating
  suprathermal protons up to 100 MeV and beyond after some number of minutes. Extrapolations
  of our simulation results indicate, however, that the wave intensities may reach
  nonlinear values before acceleration to GeV energies occurs in the corona. This
  may mean that the quasi-linear approach has to be replaced by a more general theory
  to describe particle acceleration at quasi- parallel coronal shocks in the largest
  SEP events.
