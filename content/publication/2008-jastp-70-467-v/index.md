abstract: We have recently presented a numerical model to simulate the acceleration
  and transport of energetic particles at coronal shock waves, which includes the
  back-reaction of the energetic particles on the Alfv√©n waves responsible for their
  scattering in the ambient medium [Vainio, R., Laitinen, T., 2007. Monte Carlo simulations
  of coronal diffusive shock acceleration in self-generated turbulence. Astrophysical
  Journal 658, 622-630]. The model results imply that the acceleration of energetic
  protons to energies exceeding 100 MeV can occur in some minutes in parallel coronal
  shocks driven by fast CMEs. In this paper we give a detailed description of the
  numerical model and its foreseen extensions. We extend the parameter study presented
  in the first paper to cover (shorter and) longer time scales, and present the intensities
  observed in the interplanetary medium during the initial phases of an SEP event.
  We also study the scattering mean free path resulting from the self-consistent computations.
  Finally, the potential of the model to explain ion acceleration up to relativistic
  energies is discussed.
