abstract: 'Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energy in the GeV range
  can propagate to Earth from their acceleration region near the Sun and produce ground
  level enhancements (GLEs). The traditional approach to interpreting and modelling
  GLE observations assumes particle propagation which is only parallel to the magnetic
  field lines of interplanetary space, that is, spatially 1D propagation. Recent measurements
  by PAMELA have characterised SEP properties at 1 AU for the ensuremathâˆ¼100 MeV-1
  GeV range at high spectral resolution.  Aims: We model the transport of GLE- energy
  solar protons using a 3D approach to assess the effect of the heliospheric current
  sheet (HCS) and drifts associated to the gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral.
  We derive 1 AU observables and compare the simulation results with data from PAMELA.  Methods:
  We use a 3D test particle model including a HCS. Monoenergetic populations are studied
  first to obtain a qualitative picture of propagation patterns and numbers of crossings
  of the 1 AU sphere. Simulations for power law injection are used to derive intensity
  profiles and fluence spectra at 1 AU. A simulation for a specific event, GLE 71,
  is used for comparison purposes with PAMELA data.  Results: Spatial patterns of
  1 AU crossings and the average number of crossings per particle are strongly influenced
  by 3D effects, with significant differences between periods of A$^+$ and A$^-$ polarities.
  The decay time constant of 1 AU intensity profiles varies depending on the position
  of the observer and it is not a simple function of the mean free path as in 1D models.
  Energy dependent leakage from the injection flux tube is particularly important
  for GLE energy particles, resulting in a rollover in the spectrum.'
