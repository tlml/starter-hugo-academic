abstract: Forecasting Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) fluence, as integrated over an
  SEP event, is an important element when estimating the effect of solar eruptions
  on humans and technology in space. Current real-time estimates are based on SEP
  measurements at a single location in space. However, the interplanetary magnetic
  field corotates with the Sun approximately 13° each day with respect to Earth, thus
  in 4 days a near-Earth spacecraft will have changed their connection about 60° from
  the original SEP source. We estimate the effect of the corotation on particle fluence
  using a simple particle transport model, and show that ignoring corotation can cause
  up to an order of magnitude error in fluence estimations, depending on the interplanetary
  particle transport conditions. We compare the model predictions with STEREO observations
  of SEP events.
