abstract: Cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes in the heliosphere are affected by the transient
  interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), causing so-called Forbush decreases
  (FDs), characterized by a decline of up to 25% in the neutron monitor counts at
  the Earth's surface, lasting up to over a week. FDs are thought to be caused by
  the ICME shock wave or the magnetic flux rope embedded in the ICME inhibiting CR
  propagation through the ICME structure. FDs are typically modeled as enhanced diffusion
  within the ICME structure. However, so far modeling has not considered the access
  of the CRs from the interplanetary field lines into the isolated magnetic field
  lines of the ICME flux rope. We study the effect of an ICME flux rope on particle
  propagation by using full-orbit particle simulations, with the interface between
  the external interplanetary magnetic field and the isolated flux rope field lines
  modeled analytically. We find that the particles can access the flux rope through
  the x-point region, where the external magnetic fields cancel the azimuthal component
  of the rope field. The transport through this region is fast compared to diffusive
  radial propagation within the rope. As a result, the propagation of CRs into the
  flux rope can be modeled as diffusion into a cylinder. The density cavity within
  the rope is asymmetric, and limited to the magnetic field lines isolated from the
  external field. Thus, in order to evaluate the role of the flux rope in FDs, one
  must analyze the extent of the region where the flux rope magnetic field lines are
  separated from the interplanetary magnetic fields.
