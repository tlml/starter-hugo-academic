abstract: Recent observations on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
  indicate that acceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs) at intermediate scales
  in the solar corona, between flare acceleration and interplanetary CME-driven shock
  acceleration, significantly contributes to the production of >10 MeV protons. Coronal
  shocks seem to be the most plausible candidate for the post-impulsive phase acceleration,
  which emits Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~1-100 MeV protons into the interplanetary medium for about
  1 hr after the flare. We have employed a Monte Carlo technique to model the diffusive
  shock acceleration of protons in a turbulent layer at the base of the solar wind.
  We find that a power-law spectrum of energetic protons can be emitted from the trailing
  turbulent layer left behind the shock into the solar wind for a few tens of minutes
  after the CME liftoff. In contrast to an earlier expectation, the propagation direction
  of the shock wave is found not to be crucial. Both outward-propagating and refracting
  shocks can load the corona with energetic protons. Those protons escape into the
  interplanetary medium well after the passage of the shock. We have studied successive
  transformations of the particle spectra during shock acceleration, coronal transport,
  and possible reacceleration, for different populations of seed particles. The simulated
  production time profiles and energy spectra are found to be consistent with observations
  of the 1996 July 9 event by the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE)
  instrument on board SOHO. The new model can be easily combined with our previous
  interplanetary transport models, forming a basis on which to interpret SEP observations
  made at 1 AU.
