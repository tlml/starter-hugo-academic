abstract: Major solar energetic particle events are associated with shock waves in
  solar corona and solar wind. Fast scattering of charged particles by plasma turbulence
  near the shock wave increases the efficiency of the particle acceleration in the
  shock, but prevents particles from escaping ahead of the shock. However, the turbulence
  energy levels in neighboring magnetic tubes of solar wind may differ from each other
  by more than one order of magnitude. We present the first theoretical study of accelerated
  particle emission from an oblique shock wave propagating through an intermittent
  turbulence background that consists of both highly turbulent magnetic tubes, where
  particles are accelerated, and quiet tubes, via which the accelerated particles
  can escape to the non-shocked solar wind. The modeling results imply that the presence
  of the fast transport channels penetrating the shock and cross-field transport of
  accelerated particles to those channels may play a key role in high-energy particle
  emission from distant shocks and can explain the prompt onset of major solar energetic
  particle events observed near the Earth's orbit.
