abstract: The results of full-orbit test-particle simulations of SEPs propagating
  through an IMF which exhibits large-scale fluctuations are presented. A variety
  of propagation conditions are simulated - scatter-free, and scattering with mean
  free path, ensuremathłambda, of 0.3 and 2.0 AU - and the cross-field transport of
  SEPs is investigated. When calculating cross-field displacements the Parker spiral
  geometry is accounted for and the role of magnetic field expansion is taken into
  account. It is found that transport across the magnetic field is enhanced in the
  ensuremathłambda =0.3 AU and ensuremathłambda =2 AU cases, compared to the scatter-free
  case, with the ensuremathłambda =2 AU case in particular containing outlying particles
  that had strayed a large distance across the IMF. Outliers are catergorized by means
  of Chauvenet's criterion and it is found that typically between 1 and 2% of the
  population falls within this category. The ratio of latitudinal to longitudinal
  diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the magnetic field is typically 0.2, suggesting
  that transport in latitude is less efficient.
