abstract: Observations and modeling suggest that the fluctuations in magnetized plasmas
  exhibit scale-dependent anisotropy, with more energy in the fluctuations perpendicular
  to the mean magnetic field than in the parallel fluctuations and the anisotropy
  increasing at smaller scales. The scale dependence of the anisotropy has not been
  studied in full-orbit simulations of particle transport in turbulent plasmas so
  far. In this paper, we construct a model of critically balanced turbulence, as suggested
  by Goldreich & Sridhar, and calculate energetic particle spatial diffusion coefficients
  using full-orbit simulations. The model uses an enveloped turbulence approach, where
  each two-dimensional wave mode with wavenumber k $_</SUB> is packed into envelopes
  of length L following the critical balance condition, Lvpropk $^-2/3$ <SUB>$, with
  the wave mode parameters changing between envelopes. Using full-orbit particle simulations,
  we find that both the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients increase
  by a factor of two, compared to previous models with scale-independent anisotropy.
