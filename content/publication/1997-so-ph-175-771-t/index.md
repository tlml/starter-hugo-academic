abstract: A solar energetic particle event was observed on 9 July 1996, by the ERNE
  sensors LED and HED on board the SOHO spacecraft. The arrival of the first protons
  in the energy range >20 MeV took place at 09:55 UT, 43 min after the maximum in
  the X-ray and HensuremathÎ± radiation of a flare located at S10 W30. The rise phase
  of the particle intensities at all energies was exceptionally rapid. At 12:50 UT,
  the intensities dropped in all energy channels. Simultaneously, the magnetic field
  instrument MFI on board WIND, not far from SOHO, detected a sharp and large change
  in the magnetic field direction. The analysis of the directional measurements of
  ERNE in the energy range 14 17 MeV shows the presence of a strong flux anisotropy
  during the whole period 10:10 12:50 UT. From 12:50 UT until about 16:00 UT, the
  directional analysis of the proton fluxes gives only a weak anisotropy at the limit
  of the sensor resolution. Later on, the flux anisotropy was found to recur, indicating
  a continuous injection of particles into the flux tubes connected to the SOHO spacecraft.
  These experimental results lead to strict limits on particle injection and transport
  models. The first period of the anisotropy and its recurrent phase cover 24 hours.
  This suggests an extended injection of particles. The strength and stability of
  the anisotropy indicate that, during these periods, SOHO was in an interplanetary
  sector where the particle transport was almost scatter-free. On the other hand,
  during the intermediate 3-hr period, we observed particles which traveled in a sector
  of diffusive transport or which were retarded by magnetic field disturbances not
  far from the observation site.
