abstract: With the first observations of solar ensuremathγ-rays from the decay of
  pions, the relationship of protons producing ground level enhancements (GLEs) on
  the Earth to those of similar energies producing the ensuremathγ-rays on the Sun
  has been debated. These two populations may be either independent and simply coincident
  in large flares, or they may be, in fact, the same population stemming from a single
  accelerating agent and jointly distributed at the Sun and also in space. Assuming
  the latter, we model a scenario in which particles are accelerated near the Sun
  in a shock wave with a fraction transported back to the solar surface to radiate,
  while the remainder is detected at Earth in the form of a GLE. Interplanetary ions
  versus ions interacting at the Sun are studied for a spherical shock wave propagating
  in a radial magnetic field through a highly turbulent radial ray (the acceleration
  core) and surrounding weakly turbulent sector in which the accelerated particles
  can propagate toward or away from the Sun. The model presented here accounts for
  both the first-order Fermi acceleration at the shock front and the second-order,
  stochastic re-acceleration by the turbulence enhanced behind the shock. We find
  that the re-acceleration is important in generating the ensuremathγ-radiation and
  we also find that up to 10% of the particle population can find its way to the Sun
  as compared to particles escaping to the interplanetary space.
