abstract: We study the ratio of the numbers of interplanetary to interacting protons,
  ensuremathΓ, using a model of stochastic acceleration on open magnetic field lines
  in solar corona. The impact of diverging coronal magnetic field lines is incorporated
  into the particle transport operator and shown to be unavoidable, no matter how
  small the mean free path may be. We calculate the energy spectra of protons precipitating
  into the subcoronal regions (interacting protons) and the spectra of protons escaping
  into the interplanetary medium (interplanetary protons). In the case in which both
  injection and the magnetic field exponentially decrease with altitude, the proton
  spectra for interacting particles are steeper than the corresponding spectra in
  interplanetary space. The deduced high-energy ratio ensuremathΓ varies from 1 to
  åisebox-0.5ex~5, being almost independent on a magnetic mirror ratio beneath the
  acceleration region if the latter ratio does not exceed typically i̊sebox-0.5ex~10.
  A quantitative relation between the interplanetary to interacting proton ratio and
  the magnetic field change from the top of the interaction region to the top of the
  acceleration region is established. The model results are qualitatively consistent
  with patterns of energetic protons, ensuremathγ-rays, and neutrons produced during
  the approximately 40 minutes after the impulsive phase of the 1990 May 24 solar
  flare.
