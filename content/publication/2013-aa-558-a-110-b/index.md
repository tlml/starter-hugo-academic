abstract: "Context. Diffusive shock acceleration in the solar corona can accelerate\
  \ solar energetic particles to very high energies. Acceleration efficiency is increased\
  \ by entrapment through self-generated waves, which is highly dependent on the amount\
  \ of accelerated particles. This, in turn, is determined by the efficiency of particle\
  \ injection into the acceleration process.  Aims: We present an analysis of the\
  \ injection efficiency at coronal shocks of varying obliquity. We assessed injection\
  \ through reflection and downstream scattering, including the effect of a cross-shock\
  \ potential. Both quasi-thermal and suprathermal seed populations were analysed.\
  \ We present results on the effect of cross-field diffusion downstream of the shock\
  \ on the injection efficiency.  Methods: Using analytical methods, we present applicable\
  \ injection speed thresholds that were compared with both semi-analytical flux integration\
  \ and Monte Carlo simulations, which do not resort to binary thresholds. Shock-normal\
  \ angle ensuremathþeta$_Bn$ and shock-normal velocity V$_s$ were varied to assess\
  \ the injection efficiency with respect to these parameters.  Results: We present\
  \ evidence of a significant bias of thermal seed particle injection at small shock-normal\
  \ angles. We show that downstream isotropisation methods affect the ensuremathþeta$_Bn$-dependence\
  \ of this result. We show a non-negligible effect caused by the cross-shock potential,\
  \ and that the effect of downstream cross- field diffusion is highly dependent on\
  \ boundary definitions.  Conclusions: Our results show that for Monte Carlo simulations\
  \ of coronal shock acceleration a full distribution function assessment with downstream\
  \ isotropisation through scatterings is necessary to realistically model particle\
  \ injection. Based on our results, seed particle injection at quasi-parallel coronal\
  \ shocks can result in significant acceleration efficiency, especially when combined\
  \ with varying field-line geometry. Appendices are available in electronic form\
