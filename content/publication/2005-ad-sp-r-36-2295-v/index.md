abstract: We have studied statistically associations of moderate and intense geomagnetic
  storms with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and energetic particle events. The goal
  was to identify specific energetic particle signatures, which could be used to improve
  the predictions of the geoeffectiveness of full and partial halo CMEs. Protons in
  the range 1-110 MeV from the ERNE experiment onboard SOHO are used in the analysis.
  The study covers the time period from August 1996 to July 2000. We demonstrate the
  feasibility of energetic particle observations as an additional source of information
  in evaluating the geoeffectiveness of full and partial halo CMEs. Based on the observed
  onset times of solar energetic particle (SEP) events and energetic storm particle
  (ESP) events, we derive a proxy for the transit times of shocks driven by the interplanetary
  counterparts of coronal mass ejections from the Sun to the Earth. For a limited
  number of geomagnetic storms which can be associated to both SEP and ESP signatures,
  we found that this transit time correlates with the strength of geomagnetic storms.
