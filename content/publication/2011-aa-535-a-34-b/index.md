abstract: Context. Acceleration in coronal mass ejection driven shocks is currently
  considered the primary source of large solar energetic particle events. Aims. The
  solar wind, which feeds shock- accelerated particles, includes numerous ion populations,
  which offer much insight into acceleration processes. We present first simulations
  of shock-accelerated minor ions, in order to explore trapping dynamics and acceleration
  timescales in detail. Methods. We have simulated diffusive shock acceleration of
  minor ions ($^3$He$^2+$, $^4$He$^2+$, $^16$O$^6+$ and $^56$Fe$^14+$) and protons
  using a Monte Carlo method, where self-generated Alfv√©nic turbulence allows for
  repeated shock crossings and acceleration to high energies. Results. We present
  the effect of minor ions on wave generation, especially at low wavenumbers, and
  show that it is significant. We find that maximum ion energy is determined by the
  competing effects of particle escape due to focusing in an expanding flux tube and
  trapping due to the amplified turbulence. We show the dependence of cut-off energy
  on the particle charge to mass ratio to be approximately (Q/A)$^1.5$. Conclusions.
  We suggest that understanding the acceleration of minor ions at coronal shocks requires
  simulations which allow us to explore trapping dynamics and acceleration timescales
  in detail, including evolution of the turbulent trapping boundary. We conclude that
  steady-state models do not adequately describe the acceleration of heavy ions in
  coronal shocks.
