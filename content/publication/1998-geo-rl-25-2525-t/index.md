abstract: During the period from January through mid-May, 1997, four large Earth-
  directed CMEs were observed by the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronograph (LASCO).
  These CMEs were associated with long- lasting fluxes of >1.6 MeV protons detected
  by the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron instrument (ERNE). However,
  the magnitudes of energetic proton events differed dramatically on different occasions.
  In strong proton events, production of 10-50 MeV protons started during expansion
  of the coronal Moreton wave in the western hemisphere of the Sun. The new SOHO observations
  suggest that potentialities of CMEs to produce energetic particles in the interplanetary
  medium crucially depend on the previous evolution of the explosion below ensuremath∼2R$_ensuremathødot$.
  Forecasting of the near-Earth >10 MeV proton intensity requires multiwavelength
  observations of the early phase of an event particularly the Extreme-ultraviolet
  Imaging Telescope (EIT) observations.
