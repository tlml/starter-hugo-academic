abstract: The solar wind wave heating models require substantial amount of wave power
  in order to efficiently heat and accelerate solar wind. The level of fluctuations
  is however limited by energetic particle observations. The simplest cyclotron sweep
  models result in convection-dominated transport, contradicting observations. However,
  models incorporating wave-wave -interactions, which cause wave energy to cascade
  in wavenumber, allow more reasonable energetic particle transport in the interplanetary
  space. The mean free path of the energetic particles remains still relatively short
  in the corona, providing favorable conditions for coronal mass ejection (CME) related
  shock acceleration. We study the consequences of this scenario on the energetic
  particle production related to CMEs. The role of self-generated waves is also discussed.
