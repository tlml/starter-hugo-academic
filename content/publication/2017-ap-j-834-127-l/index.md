abstract: Current particle transport models describe the propagation of charged particles
  across the mean field direction in turbulent plasmas as diffusion. However, recent
  studies suggest that at short timescales, such as soon after solar energetic particle
  (SEP) injection, particles remain on turbulently meandering field lines, which results
  in nondiffusive initial propagation across the mean magnetic field. In this work,
  we use a new technique to investigate how the particles are displaced from their
  original field lines, and we quantify the parameters of the transition from field-aligned
  particle propagation along meandering field lines to particle diffusion across the
  mean magnetic field. We show that the initial decoupling of the particles from the
  field lines is slow, and particles remain within a Larmor radius from their initial
  meandering field lines for tens to hundreds of Larmor periods, for 0.1-10 MeV protons
  in turbulence conditions typical of the solar wind at 1 au. Subsequently, particles
  decouple from their initial field lines and after hundreds to thousands of Larmor
  periods reach time-asymptotic diffusive behavior consistent with particle diffusion
  across the mean field caused by the meandering of the field lines. We show that
  the typical duration of the prediffusive phase, hours to tens of hours for 10 MeV
  protons in 1 au solar wind turbulence conditions, is significant for SEP propagation
  to 1 au and must be taken into account when modeling SEP propagation in the interplanetary
  space.
