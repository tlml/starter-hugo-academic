abstract: To understand the origin of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs), we must study
  their injection time relative to other solar eruption manifestations. Traditionally
  the injection time is determined using the Velocity Dispersion Analysis (VDA) where
  a linear fit of the observed event onset times at 1 AU to the inverse velocities
  of SEPs is used to derive the injection time and path length of the first-arriving
  particles. VDA does not, however, take into account that the particles that produce
  a statistically observable onset at 1 AU have scattered in the interplanetary space.
  We use Monte Carlo test particle simulations of energetic protons to study the effect
  of particle scattering on the observable SEP event onset above pre-event background,
  and consequently on VDA results. We find that the VDA results are sensitive to the
  properties of the pre-event and event particle spectra as well as SEP injection
  and scattering parameters. In particular, a VDA-obtained path length that is close
  to the nominal Parker spiral length does not imply that the VDA injection time is
  correct. We study the delay to the observed onset caused by scattering of the particles
  and derive a simple estimate for the delay time by using the rate of intensity increase
  at the SEP onset as a parameter. We apply the correction to a magnetically well-connected
  SEP event of 2000 June 10, and show it to improve both the path length and injection
  time estimates, while also increasing the error limits to better reflect the inherent
  uncertainties of VDA.
