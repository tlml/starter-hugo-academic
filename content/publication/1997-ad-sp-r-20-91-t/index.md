abstract: The observations of the ERNE instrument on-board the SOHO spacecraft are
  analysed. The main period under study is from the beginning of May till mid-October
  1996. Only very small energetic particle events were observed. A comparison of the
  ERNE measurements with energetic particle observations during the two previous solar
  minima indicates that the flux levels of protons during the first half of 1996 are
  exceptionally low. The daily counting rates of quiet-time protons and 4̂He in the
  energy range 13-100 MeV/nucleon show statistically significant variations with time.
  Following two energetic particle events in July and August, anticorrelations were
  found between enhancements of low energy protons in the range 1.5-8 MeV, possibly
  accelerated in a corotating interaction region, and the modulation of high energy
  protons and helium above 13 MeV/nucleon. The period of the observed anticorrelations
  coincide with the solar rotation period.
