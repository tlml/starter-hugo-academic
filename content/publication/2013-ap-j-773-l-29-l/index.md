abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) have been observed to easily spread across
  heliographic longitudes, and the mechanisms responsible for this behavior remain
  unclear. We use full-orbit simulations of a 10 MeV proton beam in a turbulent magnetic
  field to study to what extent the spread across the mean field can be described
  as diffusion early in a particle event. We compare the full- orbit code results
  to solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation including spatial and pitch angle diffusion,
  and of one including also propagation of the particles along random-walking magnetic
  field lines. We find that propagation of the particles along meandering field lines
  is the key process determining their cross-field spread at 1 AU at the beginning
  of the simulated event. The mean square displacement of the particles an hour after
  injection is an order of magnitude larger than that given by the diffusion model,
  indicating that models employing spatial cross-field diffusion cannot be used to
  describe early evolution of an SEP event. On the other hand, the diffusion of the
  particles from their initial field lines is negligible during the first 5 hr, which
  is consistent with the observations of SEP intensity dropouts. We conclude that
  modeling SEP events must take into account the particle propagation along meandering
  field lines for the first 20 hr of the event.
