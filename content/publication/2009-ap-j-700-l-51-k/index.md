abstract: On 2000 April 4-6 the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron particle
  telescope on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft observed a major
  solar energetic particle (SEP) event associated with two coronal mass ejections
  (CMEs) separated by approximately 8 hr. The first CME was accompanied by a low-
  frequency type II radio burst observed by the WAVES receivers on the Wind spacecraft.
  Analysis of the high-precision measurements of the åisebox-0.5ex~20 MeV proton flux
  anisotropy, model fitting of the type II dynamic spectrum, and SEP transport modeling
  support the idea that the shock wave of the first CME was an efficient accelerator
  for i̊sebox-0.5ex~20 MeV protons during only the first 6 hr after the launch. This
  shock gradually slowed down, weakened, and became transparent for the protons produced
  by the second eruption behind the previous CME. The main production of SEPs due
  to the two successive eruptions continued together for 12 hr. The near-Earth SEP
  event was additionally amplified by the SEP mirroring in the interplanetary magnetic
  field draping at the edge of an old CME beyond the Earth's orbit, which made the
  SEP intensity-time profiles more prolonged than would be expected based on the assumption
  of SEP transport in the standard solar wind.
