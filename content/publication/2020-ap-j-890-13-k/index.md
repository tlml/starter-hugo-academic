abstract: We analyze the relativistic proton emission from the Sun during the eruptive
  event on 2017 September 10, which caused a ground-level enhancement (GLE 72) registered
  by the worldwide network of neutron monitors. Using the neutron monitor data and
  interplanetary transport modeling both along and across interplanetary magnetic
  field (IMF) lines, we deduce parameters of the proton injection into the interplanetary
  medium. The inferred injection profile of the interplanetary protons is compared
  with the profile of the >100 MeV ensuremathγ-ray emission observed by the Fermi
  Large Area Telescope, attributed to pion production from the interaction of >300
  MeV protons at the Sun. GLE 72 started with a prompt component that arrived along
  the IMF lines. This was followed by a more prolonged enhancement caused by protons
  arriving at the Earth across the IMF lines from the southwest. The interplanetary
  proton event is modeled using two sources—one source at the root of the Earth- connected
  IMF line and another source situated near the solar western limb. The maximum phase
  of the second injection of interplanetary protons coincides with the maximum phase
  of the prolonged >100 MeV ensuremathγ-ray emission that originated from a small
  area at the solar western limb, below the current sheet trailing the associated
  coronal mass ejection (CME). A possible common source of interacting protons and
  interplanetary protons is discussed in terms of proton acceleration at the CME bow
  shock versus coronal (re-)acceleration in the wake of the CME.
