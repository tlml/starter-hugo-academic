abstract: 'Context. The intensity profiles of iron and oxygen in Solar Energetic Particle
  (SEP) events often display differences that result in a decreasing Fe/O ratio over
  time. The physical mechanisms behind this behaviour are not fully understood, but
  these observational signatures provide important tests of physical modelling efforts.  Aims:
  In this paper we study the propagation of iron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model
  of propagation which includes the effect of guiding centre drift in a Parker spiral
  magnetic field. We derive time intensity profiles for a variety of observer locations
  and study the temporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio.  Methods: We use a 3D full orbit
  test particle model which includes scattering. The configuration of the interplanetary
  magnetic field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are released instantaneously
  from a compact region at two solar radii and allowed to propagate in 3D.  Results:
  Both Fe and O experience significant transport across the magnetic field due to
  gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions drift more than O ions due to
  their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so that an observer that is not magnetically
  well connected to the source region will observe Fe arriving before O, for particles
  within the same range in energy per nucleon. As a result, for the majority of observer
  locations, the Fe/O ratio displays a decrease in time.  Conclusions: We conclude
  that propagation effects associated with drifts produce a decay over time of the
  Fe/O ratio, qualitatively reproducing that observed in SEP event profiles.'
