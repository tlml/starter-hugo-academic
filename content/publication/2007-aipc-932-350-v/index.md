abstract: Recent efforts on modeling coronal turbulence transport and shock acceleration
  self-consistently are reviewed. The considered models are based on the assumption
  that the turbulence responsible for the scattering of energetic ions consists of
  slab-mode Alfv√©n waves. A short discussion of the applied wave transport equation
  and particle transport coefficients is followed by a more extensive review of analytical
  and numerical modeling results of coupled evolution of energetic particle fluxes
  and wave intensities.
