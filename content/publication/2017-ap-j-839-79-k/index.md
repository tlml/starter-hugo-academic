abstract: We analyze the high-energy particle emission from the Sun in two extreme
  solar particle events in which protons are accelerated to relativistic energies
  and can cause a significant signal even in the ground-based particle detectors.
  Analysis of a relativistic proton event is based on modeling of the particle transport
  and interaction, from a near-Sun source through the solar wind and the Earthtextquoterights
  magnetosphere and atmosphere to a detector on the ground. This allows us to deduce
  the time profile of the proton source at the Sun and compare it with observed electromagnetic
  emissions. The 1998 May 2 event is associated with a flare and a coronal mass ejection
  (CME), which were well observed by the Nan√ßay Radioheliograph, thus the images of
  the radio sources are available. For the 2003 November 2 event, the low corona images
  of the CME liftoff obtained at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory are available. Those
  complementary data sets are analyzed jointly with the broadband dynamic radio spectra,
  EUV images, and other data available for both events. We find a common scenario
  for both eruptions, including the flaretextquoterights dual impulsive phase, the
  CME-launch-associated decimetric-continuum burst, and the late, low-frequency type
  III radio bursts at the time of the relativistic proton injection into the interplanetary
  medium. The analysis supports the idea that the two considered events start with
  emission of relativistic protons previously accelerated during the flare and CME
  launch, then trapped in large-scale magnetic loops and later released by the expanding
  CME.
