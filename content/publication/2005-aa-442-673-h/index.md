abstract: We determine the proton and helium nuclei release times at the Sun for 25
  SEP events within the time period May 8, 1996-June 20, 2001, and compare them to
  each other. The event onset times at 1 AU are determined with a Poisson-CUSUM method,
  and the solar release times are obtained by the velocity dispersion analysis. Velocity
  dispersions were derived in the energy range 14-51 MeV/n. If the release times of
  protons and helium nuclei do not overlap within their error limits, and if protons
  are released earlier than helium, then the helium event is defined as ``delayed''.
  Seventeen helium events (68%) were found to be ``delayed'' and only eight (32%)
  ``non-delayed''. The average delay was (34 ensuremathÂ± 18) minutes. The event-related
  flare location had an important role in the ``non-delayed'' events. A significant
  difference was found in the helium-to- proton ratios at the time of maximum intensity
  of the ``delayed'' and ``non-delayed'' events. No clear evidence was found that
  the ``delayed'' and ``non-delayed'' events would correspond the classical gradual-impulsive
  division of SEP events. We find that the delay is related to the poor magnetic connection
  between the flare site and the spacecraft.
