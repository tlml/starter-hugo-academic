abstract: The onset of the >10-MeV proton event of August 13-14, 1996, revealed a
  velocity dispersion, which is a signature of its solar origin, but no associated
  soft X ray flare was observed. The LASCO CME observations, the presence of AR 7981
  beyond the west limb, and type II and IV radio burst timing with respect to the
  proton event onset indicate that the parent solar eruption may be centered on the
  back side of the Sun, at åisebox-0.5ex~150°W. In such a case, expanding CME-associated
  wave can reach the Earth- connected interplanetary magnetic field line in i̊sebox-0.5ex~1
  hour and so give rise to the >10-MeV proton event observed with the Energetic and
  Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) instrument onboard SOHO. We verify this
  hypothesis against observational data and conclude that a solar back side eruption
  is the most plausible explanation of the August 13, 1996, event. We compare the
  August 13, 1996, event with events associated with Earth directed CMEs and show
  that the August 13, 1996, event reveals many properties common to >10-MeV proton
  events originating from solar eruptions centered rs̊ebox-0.5ex~90° away from the
  root of the Earth-connected interplanetary magnetic field line. In such events,
  the first detected protons are released rae̊box-0.5ex~1 hour after the start time
  of type II and IV radio bursts. The first injection spectrum is essentially harder
  than the spectrum at the intensity maximum; that is, the hard but less intensive
  proton production is followed by the major soft-spectrum production when CME expands
  farther from the Sun.
