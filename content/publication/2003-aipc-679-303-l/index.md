abstract: Wave damping and cascading processes have been found to be important for
  the heating and acceleration of the solar wind. However, it remains a difficult
  task to extract details of these processes from observations of the thermal plasma
  only. The wave power required for efficient heating and acceleration of the solar
  wind also affects the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles. Thus,
  their observation could provide valuable clues for the actual evolution of the wave
  power close to the coronal base and, in turn, give constraints for solar wind modeling.
  Pursuing this idea, we have developed a steady- state two-fluid model for the wave
  heating and acceleration of the solar wind. The dissipation frequency determining
  the heating is obtained from a cyclotron damping rate that depends on the plasma
  beta and, thus, differs from the usual assumption, a fixed fraction of the ion cyclotron
  frequency. We present first results obtained with the two-fluid code and, in particular,
  discuss the implications of the corresponding mean free path of energetic particles.
