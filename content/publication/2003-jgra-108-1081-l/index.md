abstract: We have developed a steady state two-fluid description of the radial solar
  wind expansion close to the coronal base. The model is formulated self-consistently
  with respect to the radial evolution of turbulence by supplementing the moment equations
  of the plasma with an equation describing the radial evolution of the Alfv√©n wave
  power as originally suggested by [1984]. We assume that there is sufficient wave
  power in the ion-cyclotron frequency range and determine the resulting acceleration
  and heating rates of the thermal plasma in the corona and interplanetary space.
  In improvement of earlier models of the nonlocal dynamics of the expanding corona,
  the dissipation frequency is determined self-consistently from the ion-cyclotron
  damping rate. After demonstrating that the time-independent modeling can correctly
  reproduce the solutions obtained with (in the above sense) non-self-consistent models,
  the significance of the self-consistent treatment is pointed out. The new solutions
  are studied in detail, and their implications for the transport of solar energetic
  particles are discussed.
