abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs), accelerated during solar eruptions, propagate
  in turbulent solar wind before being observed with in situ instruments. In order
  to interpret their origin through comparison with remote sensing observations of
  the solar eruption, we thus must deconvolve the transport effects due to the turbulent
  magnetic fields from the SEP observations. Recent research suggests that the SEP
  propagation is guided by the turbulent meandering of the magnetic fieldlines across
  the mean magnetic field. However, the lengthening of the distance the SEPs travel,
  due to the fieldline meandering, has so far not been included in SEP event analysis.
  This omission can cause significant errors in estimation of the release times of
  SEPs at the Sun. We investigate the distance traveled by the SEPs by considering
  them to propagate along fieldlines that meander around closed magnetic islands that
  are inherent in turbulent plasma. We introduce a fieldline random walk model which
  takes into account the physical scales associated to the magnetic islands. Our method
  remedies the problem of the diffusion equation resulting in unrealistically short
  pathlengths, and the fractal dependence of the pathlength of random walk on the
  length of the random-walk step. We find that the pathlength from the Sun to 1 au
  can be below the nominal Parker spiral length for SEP events taking place at solar
  longitudes 45E to 60W, whereas the western and behind-the-limb particles can experience
  pathlengths longer than 2 au due to fieldline meandering.
