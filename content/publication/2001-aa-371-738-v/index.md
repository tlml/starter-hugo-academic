abstract: Cyclotron resonance with high-frequency Alfvén waves has been proposed as
  an ion heating mechanism for producing high-speed winds and large ion temperatures
  in coronal holes. In the simplest version of the model (cyclotron sweep model),
  the waves propagate without interacting until they hit a resonance with the plasma
  ions at distance, where the ion cyclotron frequency becomes comparable to the wave
  frequency. We calculate the energetic test-particle mean free path lambda in solar
  corona heated by this mechanism. The primary result of our study is that energetic
  particles are efficiently coupled to the high- frequency MHD waves and may, thus,
  provide important feed back to wave-heating models. Detailed calculations are presented
  for a solar-wind stream of intermediate speed driven by the cyclotron sweep mechanism
  applying an extended quasi-linear theory for the mean free path. A local maximum
  of lambda is located near r=2 R_ensuremathødot , but lambda is very small at distances
  close to the Sun ( r<1.3 R_ensuremathødot ) helping the acceleration of particles
  to high energies on open coronal field lines there. Another minimum for the mean
  free path is obtained near r=10 R_ensuremathødot enabling ion acceleration beyond
  10 MeV/n in streams of intermediate speeds by CME shock waves in the test-particle
  approximation. However, the presence of high- frequency Alfvén waves in amounts
  required for the cyclotron sweep heating has to be limited below åisebox-0.5ex~
  10 R$_sun$ on field lines close to the ecliptic to avoid discrepancies with the
  inferred arrival times of solar energetic particles. Non-linear effects are discussed
  as a possible mechanism for removing the wave excess from the plasma.
