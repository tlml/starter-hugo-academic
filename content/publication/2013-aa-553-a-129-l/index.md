abstract: High-energy particles stream during coronal mass ejections or flares through
  the plasma of the solar wind. This causes instabilities, which lead to wave growth
  at specific resonant wave numbers, especially within shock regions. These amplified
  wave modes influence the turbulent scattering process significantly. In this paper,
  results of particle transport and scattering in turbulent plasmas with excited wave
  modes are presented. The method used is a hybrid simulation code, which treats the
  heliospheric turbulence by an incompressible magnetohydrodynamic approach separately
  from a kinetic particle description. Furthermore, a semi-analytical model using
  quasilinear theory (QLT) is compared to the numerical results. This paper aims at
  a more fundamental understanding and interpretation of the pitch- angle scattering
  coefficients. Our calculations show a good agreement of particle simulations and
  the QLT for broad-band turbulent spectra; for higher turbulence levels and particle
  beam driven plasmas, the QLT approximation gets worse. Especially the resonance
  gap at ensuremathÎ¼ = 0 poses a well-known problem for QLT for steep turbulence spectra,
  whereas test-particle computations show no problems for the particles to scatter
  across this region. The reason is that the sharp resonant wave-particle interactions
  in QLT are an oversimplification of the broader resonances in test-particle calculations,
  which result from nonlinear effects not included in the QLT. We emphasise the importance
  of these results for both numerical simulations and analytical particle transport
  approaches, especially the validity of the QLT. Appendices A-D are available in
