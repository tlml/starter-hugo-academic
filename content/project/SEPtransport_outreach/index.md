My primary contribution to the SEP research currently
consists of trying to unravel the propagation of the SEPs in the
interplanetary space. As charged particles, the SEPs are affected by
electromagnetic forces, and thus, in the turbulent plasmas of the
interplanetary space, they do not propagate along a direct path from
the Sun. The follow the large-scale spiral structure, the "Parker
Spiral", of the heliospheric magnetic field, and scatter off the
magnetic field irregularities. This propagation is often described as
a combination of diffusion and convection of the particles.

Because of the scattering, we must understand the SEP propagation in
the interplanetary space in order to be able to understand how the SEP
acceleration and release at the Sun is related to other phenomena
during a Solar eruption. Unfortunately, our understanding on how to
model the spread of particles into the heliosphere is still far from
complete. 

In particular, the spread of particles across the mean
Parker Spiral magnetic field is not properly understood. This is
crucial for both understanding the SEP acceleration mechanisms, and
for the forecasting of SEP intensities at Earth, as currently we
cannot reliably determine whether the width of an SEP event is due to
the width of the acceleration region close to the Sun, or due to the
spreading of the particles in the interplanetary space.

Our contribution to understanding of the cross-field propagation goes
beyond the diffusion description of the particles, as we follow the
complete orbit of the particle in the turbulent magnetic fields. The
turbulent fields are described as superposition of waves, and the
crucial question is: how to make the modelling of turbulence as
realistic as possible. We have studied in particular the effect of
structuredness of the turbulence using envelopes to "break" the
turbulence into non-coherent packets, as the turbulence is a nonlinear
phenomenon. Our models can be used to study the rate the particles
spread in space, and how the spreading compares to other, more simple
models.
