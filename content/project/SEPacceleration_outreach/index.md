The Solar Energetic Particles are accelerate during solar eruptions,
with the acceleration believed to be connected to the flare processes,
reorganisation of the turbulent magnetic field flux tubes, and the
vast magnetic clouds that are ejected from the Sun at supersonic
speeds into the corona and interplanetary space.

I have on SEP acceleration modelling in the recent past with with Rami
Vainio (University of Turku, Finland). Our studies concentrated on SEP acceleration by the shock waves driven by the mass clouds, and the text below describes that process. 

I plan to amend this text to include information on particle acceleration in flares at a later date.

## SEP acceleration in shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections


The shock waves in the corona are related to the coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), the vast magnetic structures ejected from the Sun
during the solar eruptions. These CMEs are hurled from the Sun at
velocities faster than the magnetosonic speed, and thus drive a shock
ahead of them, as a supersonic jet does.

Such shocks are considered as the primary contributor to SEPs in large
events (although this is still debated). The particles are accelerated
by first-order Fermi mechanism, as the particles scatter in the
upstream and downstream of the shock, gaining energy at each crossing
of the shock front.

As the acceleration mechanism requires scattering, it requires
turbulent magnetic field. We are studying the effect of the
accelerated particle streams generating this turbulence themselves. In
this manner, the acceleration process can be bootstrapped: the
accelerated particles amplify the turbulence, making subsequent
acceleration even faster and more efficient.

The acceleration process is, however, highly dynamic, and we have
shown that the intensity of the injected particles is an important
factor for the attainable SEP energies and intensities. In addition,
the acceleration of minor ions depends on the evolution of the proton
acceleration in a considerable way, and the geometry of the coronal
field lines determines the attainable energies of the particles.
